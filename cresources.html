                <!-- <p>Her interests in programming websites from the age of 12 drove her to venture deep into all that computer science had to offer. Claudia taught herself all the basics of programming, and her passion inspired her own peers to learn to code too. </p> -->
                <p>
                    there's a huge lack of free & accessible coding resources online, so i compiled all of my trusty code 
                    workbooks to help teach/guide anyone on their coding journey. 
                    all of my effort is here, and completely yours for the wonderful price of <b>free</b>! 
                    <br>
                    i only hope my resources can inspire all apassioned coders to always keep learning. 
                </p>

                    <h3>For Teachers and Educators: </h3>
                    <p style="letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 125%;">
                        let me preface by saying it's perfectly okay to not know how to code. 
                        i was once a student too, and i remember how hard it was to learn how to code. 
                        i wrote my first line of code when i was 12 years old, and it was a simple HTML page.
                        i remember being so proud of myself for making a website that was all mine,
                        and i wanted to learn more about how to make my website better. but i didn't know where to start.
                        i didn't have any guides or tutorials to help me learn, and i didn't have any teachers to help me either.
                        <br><br>
                        for years, i sprained my brain trying to make sense of the guides and tutorials written by 
                        nerdy senior-level programmers who spoke in tongues foreign to my 12 year old brain (no shade to them lol).
                        it was extremely difficult trying to teach myself how to code, but i persisted, and with time, i improved.
                        i learned how to make websites, and i learned how to make games, and i learned how to make 3D models.
                        it was a long and arduous journey, but it brought me to where i am today.
                        <br><br>
                        the experience taught me a lot about how to learn, and it taught me a lot about how to teach.
                        i learned how to break down complex concepts into simple, digestible pieces of information.
                        i learned how to be patient with myself, and i learned how to be patient with others.
                        i learned how to be a good teacher, and i learned how to be a good student.
                        and now, i want to pass on that knowledge on.

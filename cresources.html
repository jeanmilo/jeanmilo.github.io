                <!-- <p>Her interests in programming websites from the age of 12 drove her to venture deep into all that computer science had to offer. Claudia taught herself all the basics of programming, and her passion inspired her own peers to learn to code too. </p> -->
                <p>
                    there's a huge lack of free & accessible coding resources online, so i compiled all of my trusty code 
                    workbooks to help teach/guide anyone on their coding journey. 
                    all of my effort is here, and completely yours for the wonderful price of <b>free</b>! 
                    <br>
                    i only hope my resources can inspire all apassioned coders to always keep learning. 
                </p>

                    <h3>For Teachers and Educators: </h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 125%;">
                        let me preface by saying it's perfectly okay to not know how to code. 
                        <br><br>
                        but this also meant that back in 2012, most people in my small, suburban, floridian town didn't know how to code. 
                        and that is not usually a problem, but this was a major dilemma when it came to me wanting to pursue CS and not having anyone to help me figure out where to start.
                        i always had a passion for computer science, yet i never had any educators who could teach/help me during my own coding journey. 
                        <br><br>
                        i struggled for years, breaking my head trying to make sense of the guides and tutorials written by nerdy senior-level programmers 
                        who spoke in tongues foreign to my 12 year old brain.
                        it was extremely difficult trying to teach myself how to code, but i persisted, spending countless summers pulling all-nighters learning JavaScript and Python. 
                        as years came and gone, more resources started appearing online, but they all had paywalls, and when money was tight, 
                        my mother couldn't risk spending 30 dollars on guidebooks published on sites that were unknown to most. 
                        it wasn't until i got to my senior year of high school that i was able to have my first CS teacher, and even he was unfortunately extremely underqualified. 
                        <br><br>
                        at such a pivotable point in my life, i was <i>sooo</i> disappointed with the cards i was handed. 
                        i know what it is like to be a disappointed student who only wanted to learn. 
                        i use that knowledge to make sure my own students never feel that way with me. so now that i have enough experience teaching, 
                        i want to pass on that knowledge on.
                        <br><br>
                        please feel free to use my own outlines as a guide for your curriculums. and please 
                        <a href="/about.html#email">feel free to email me any critiques or questions</a>! the journey of learning never ends and i am happy to attend to any feedback.

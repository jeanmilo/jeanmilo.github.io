        "it's been a slow week, but thats never a bad thing. its important to enjoy the moments of peace and quiet. there will come a time when i won't be able to slow down and enjoy simple things like binging One Piece or editing this blog, so in the meantime, i will try to take it all in (inbetween sniffles and coughs ofc).",

                        Tomorrow marks one month since my return from Brazil and im still so happy to have familial ties to such a beautiful country and peoples. 
                        I've been thinking about my time there a lot and how much I miss all of it. i'm excited to go back and see my family again sooner than later. im already planning on what gifts i plan on bringing them for my next trip... :3
                    </p>
                    <p>i will not be updating this website in a HOT minute as i am also in my final semester of university... believe it or not but calculus + operating systems + software design + computer theory + a job + a life and family is a lot to juggle... teehee ðŸ’€
                        but will update when possible (: i am worrking on an ai programme for sm of my favorite students so they 
                        can learn python coding with ai agents! so at least one section will be getting updated soon!
                    </p>

                    <h4> Jan. 03, 2025</h4>
                    <p>Happy New Year and To New Beginnings! </p> 
                    <p>i am writing this as i build the website. i had a nice amount of progress on the site today which is really great since i've been meaning to code and set everything up for a loooong  while. ive been excited about finishing the site and releasing it, so i am glad i finally got around to hosting it.
                        these blog posts on my site will be mainly related to my thoughts on making stuff (code projects, art, music, etc.) and anything else i want to put on here. 
                    </p>
                    <p>im excited to add more things here the more i work on it. im excited for the new year and all to come.</p>
                    <p>p.s. don't forget to tell your friends and family you love them today</p>
